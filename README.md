:office_worker:<b>My last Project / Works</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Park Now - App to search for a parking lot in the city of C√≥rdoba, Argentina.</b>
<br/><br/>
Application created with React and Redux, which allows you to search for nearby parking lots based on a destination entered by the user.<br/>
I worked with the google API, the Socket.io library and for the back-end we used both PHP and Node.js.<br/>
By entering the address Blamey Lafore 1463, you can see garages loaded as a test.

<b>Flama Pizza</b>

Flama Pizzas, is a place for the sale of personalized pizzas, assembled by customers.
The App aims to provide clients with a digital interface, where they can place their order faster.
It generates a ticket in which the order is detailed, it has a private section, where the owners can create or delete pizzas and/or toppings.
